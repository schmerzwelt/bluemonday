<h1>The Blue Monday Museum</h1>

<div id="text">
<h2>what</h2>
<p>The Blue Monday Museum is a recurring pop-up museum reflecting upon contemporary events by focussing on artists and creatives who share visions and beliefs about their current place and time. This can be done on both a local and a global perspective.</p>
<p>The Blue Monday Museum operates on unsettled locations and, from there, collaborates with local artists, creatives and musicians. It only appears when and where a museum is temporarily needed.</p>

<h2>why</h2>
<p>The Blue Monday Museum believes that artists and museums are destined to play a more mediative role between their audience and what is happening in the world. The museum connects various points of view by placing these individual insights in an interdependent context that is relevant for today&lsquo;s society. The Blue Monday Museum concludes that future museums must play an important role as a connecting component between people, society and current events.</p>

<h2>need</h2>
<p>Despite the existing culture in which the amount of museums is plenty we believe there are places where a more approachable museum is needed. Because The Blue Monday Museum is permanently temporary it is capable of being in a constant state of development and alteration. Therefore we are not depending on long-lasting exhibitions, an immovable establishment or local authorities.</p>

<h2>collaborate</h2>
<p>The Blue Monday Museum is eager to collaborate with various parties and keen to co-operate with other initiatives.</p>
